# Memory Movie Maker: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Vision & Opportunity

**Product Name:** Memory Movie Maker

**Vision:** To create an intelligent, conversational video editing tool that empowers anyone to transform their raw photos and videos into polished, emotionally resonant "memory movies" with minimal effort.

**Problem Statement:** People capture countless digital memories (photos, video clips) during significant life events like vacations, weddings, and holidays. However, these assets often remain disorganized and unshared because traditional video editing is time-consuming, requires technical skill, and presents a steep learning curve. Existing automated tools offer limited creative control and often fail to capture the specific "vibe" or narrative of the event.

**Opportunity:** By leveraging advanced agentic AI, we can create a "do-it-for-me" solution that understands user intent through natural language. This tool will automate the most tedious aspects of editing—selection, trimming, and synchronization—while allowing for intuitive, conversational refinement, making high-quality video creation accessible to everyone.

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **Families & Parents:** Individuals wanting to create memorable compilations of children's milestones, family vacations, and holidays without investing hours in editing.
- **Travelers & Adventurers:** Users who want to quickly produce exciting summaries of their trips to share on social media or with friends.
- **Event Goers:** People attending weddings, concerts, or parties who want to combine their footage with others' to create a collective memory.
- **Casual Content Creators:** Social media users who need a fast, easy way to generate engaging video content from raw footage.

### User Personas

#### Sarah - The Busy Parent
- Age: 35
- Tech comfort: Medium
- Pain points: No time for complex editing, wants to preserve family memories
- Goals: Create shareable videos of family milestones quickly

#### Mike - The Adventure Traveler
- Age: 28
- Tech comfort: High
- Pain points: Too much footage, wants dynamic travel videos
- Goals: Create engaging social media content from trips

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

### Core User Stories (MVP)

- **US1:** As a user, I want to upload a folder of photos and video clips so the system can use them as source material.
- **US2:** As a user, I want to upload a music track so it can be used as the video's soundtrack.
- **US3:** As a user, I want to provide a simple text prompt describing the desired length, aspect ratio, and "vibe" (e.g., "a 2-minute upbeat, vertical video of my Hawaii trip") to guide the initial creation.
- **US4:** As a user, I want to mark specific photos or videos as "required" to ensure they are included in the final cut.
- **US5:** As a user, I want the AI to autonomously analyze my media, select the best moments, and create a first draft that is rhythmically synchronized to the music.
- **US6:** As a user, I want to view the generated video in a simple web interface.
- **US7:** As a user, I want to provide iterative feedback in plain English (e.g., "make the beginning slower," "add more shots of the sunset") to refine the video.
- **US8:** As a user, I want to receive a new version of the video quickly after providing feedback.

### Extended User Stories (Post-MVP)

- **US9:** As a user, I want to collaborate with others by combining our media assets.
- **US10:** As a user, I want to apply preset themes or styles to my video.
- **US11:** As a user, I want to add text overlays and captions to specific moments.
- **US12:** As a user, I want to export videos in multiple formats and resolutions.
