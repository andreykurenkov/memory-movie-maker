## Technical Debt

### Current Issues
- None yet

### Future Refactoring
- Consider direct FFmpeg integration for better performance
- Evaluate alternative frontend frameworks
- Optimize memory usage for large projects

## Dependencies and Blockers

### External Dependencies
- Google ADK (installed via pip)
- Gemini API access (requires API key)
- Librosa library (pure Python, easy installation)

### Current Blockers
- None

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- Coverage: 36% (data models and storage layer complete)
- Target: 80%

### Integration Tests
- Status: Not started
- Target: All agent interactions tested

### End-to-End Tests
- Status: Not started
- Target: Complete workflow coverage

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance
- Not measured yet

### Target Performance
- Initial generation: <10 minutes
- Refinement: <3 minutes
- API response time: <200ms

## Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Google ADK**: Chosen for its multi-agent orchestration capabilities
2. **Gradio**: Selected for rapid UI prototyping
3. **MoviePy**: Initial choice for video rendering, may switch to FFmpeg later
4. **Filesystem Storage**: MVP approach, designed for easy migration to S3

### Key Learnings
- Will be updated as development progresses

## Review Schedule

This roadmap should be reviewed and updated:
- After completing each major task
- Weekly during active development
- Before starting each new phase

---

**Note:** Each task completion should trigger an update to this roadmap and a check-in with stakeholders.
